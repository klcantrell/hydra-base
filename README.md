### Hydra-Base
An app to help fire departments keep track of and share information about fire hydrants especially when requesting mutual aid.  The app aims to solves the problem of fire hydrant information being "tribal knowledge" that is hard to keep track of, communicate, and get access to quickly.

Hydra-Base is built on top of the Google Maps API and uses web technologies to create a cross-platform web app.  The app is intended to be used over the FirstNet network that is dedicated to the data needs of first responders.

Developed at the 2018 AT&T IoT Civic Hack in Indy.
