# AT&T IoT Civic Hack | Team Red
## HydraBase
A prototype of an app to help fire departments keep track of and share information about fire hydrants especially when requesting mutual aid.  The app aims to solve the problem of fire hydrant information being "tribal knowledge" that is hard to keep track of, communicate, and get access to quickly.

HydraBase is built on top of the Google Maps API and uses web technologies to create a cross-platform web app.  The app is intended to be used over the FirstNet network that is dedicated to the data needs of first responders.

Developed at the 2018 AT&T IoT Civic Hack in Indy.

User can:

* See the fire hydrants at a given geolocation
* Click on a fire hydrant icon to see important information about the hydrant at that location such as its hose size and thread type

Tech Highlights:

* Used the *Google Maps API* to build the user interface on top of
* Designed the app with the user stories of actual fire fighters in mind
* Developed the app on a team that worked together for the first time, had a variety of skill levels, and was on a tight timeline
